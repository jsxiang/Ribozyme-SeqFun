# Ribozyme-SeqFun

This repository contain scripts to analyze sequence and structural motifs.

compileRS_FS.m takes all RNAseq and FACSseq analysis data and converts sequences to one-hot vectors, and standardizes activity measures. 

analyzemotifs.m takes the compiled and processed data from compileRS_FS.m and performs pairwise contribution and mutual information analyses.
